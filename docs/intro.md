# What is Timeless?

Timeless is a yield tokenization protocol where the yield tokens never expire.

Timeless splits user deposits into two types of yield tokens: [Perpetual Yield Token (PYT)](concepts/pyt), whose holders receive the yield generated by the user deposits, and [Negative Yield Token (NYT)](concepts/nyt), whose market price moves in the opposite direction as PYT.

Timeless enables the following use cases:

-   **Yield boosting**: Boost the yield you earn from any supported farm by 1x-2x
-   **Yield hedging**: Decrease the volatility of the yield you earn
-   **Yield speculation**: Speculate on whether yield rates are going up or down

Timeless is built on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and deployed to EVM-compatible blockchains.

Timeless is _permissionless_, meaning you do not need permission from anyone to use any part of Timeless.

Timeless is _immutable_, meaning its business logic can never be arbitrarily modified even by the team.

Timeless is _composable_, meaning it uses common standards (ERC20, ERC4626) and thus can fit into other protocols like Lego pieces.
