# Yield Speculation

Yield speculation refers to using [PYT](./pyt) or [NYT](./nyt) to speculate on future yield rates. Specifically:

-   **Longing:** If you believe the yield rate is going up, you'd buy PYT so that you profit if the yield rate does go up.
-   **Shorting:** If you believe the yield rate is going down, you'd buy NYT so that you profit if the yield rate does go down.

In addition, you can also use lending platforms like [Fuse](https://app.rari.capital/fuse) to leverage up on your long/short position, if PYT/NYT pools are available.

## How do you do it?

Go to the [Swap page](https://timelessfi.com/swap) of our website to buy PYT or NYT.
