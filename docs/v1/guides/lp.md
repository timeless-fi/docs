Providing Liquidity and Staking on Bunni
----------------------------------------

### Step 1: Add Liquidity to the pool of your choice

*   Do you have only one of the 2 assets that are part of the pool? If so, refer to Zap

*   If you have both assets, refer to the "Add Liquidity" option

### Step 2: Deposit, or Deposit and Stake?

*   If you wish to earn oLIT rewards and swap fees directly on Bunni, approve the tokens and select "Deposit and Stake"
*   If instead you wish to earn liqLIT and LIT rewards, and swap fees on wrappers like Liquis, just select "Deposit". You can then stake your ERC-20 LP tokens on Liquis directly.

### Step 3: Harvest Rewards (Optional)

*   Over time, you will earn rewards for staking your LP tokens.
*   To collect these rewards, navigate back to the "Portfolio" section.
*   Click on "Claim oLIT" to claim your rewards.
