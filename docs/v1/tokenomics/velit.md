# veLIT

Vote-escrow LIT (veLIT) is used for voting for governance proposals and gauge weights.

veLIT is based on Curve's veCRV. See the [Curve docs](https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-vecrv.html) to learn more details.

## How do you get veLIT?

veLIT is obtained by locking Balancer 80LIT-20WETH LP tokens. The longer you lock for, the more veLIT you get, and your veLIT balance decays over time.
