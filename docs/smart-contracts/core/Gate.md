# Gate

GitHub: [link](https://github.com/timeless-fi/timeless/blob/main/src/Gate.sol)

Gate is the main contract users interact with to mint/burn NegativeYieldToken
and PerpetualYieldToken, as well as claim the yield earned by PYTs.

_Gate is an abstract contract that should be inherited from in order to support
a specific vault protocol (e.g. YearnGate supports YearnVault). Each Gate handles
all vaults & associated NYTs/PYTs of a specific vault protocol.
Vaults are yield-generating contracts used by Gate. Gate makes several assumptions about
a vault:
1) A vault has a single associated underlying token that is immutable.
2) A vault gives depositors yield denominated in the underlying token.
3) A vault depositor owns shares in the vault, which represents their deposit.
4) Vaults have a notion of "price per share", which is the amount of underlying tokens
   each vault share can be redeemed for.
5) If vault shares are represented using an ERC20 token, then the ERC20 token contract must be
   the vault contract itself._
